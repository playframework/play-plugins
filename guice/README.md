# Play 2.1
this plugin now is obsolete. Use ```play.GlobalSetting#getControllerInstance``` instead.


# For older verions of Play

# Guice Plugin

This plugin provides support for [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/)

# Features

* Allow constructor injection via delegate 

this design pattern can be achieved the same as with manual Injection. 
[This] (https://github.com/typesafehub/play-plugins/tree/master/inject/sample_without_static_field) sample app demonstrates it.

* Allows static field injection to a preconfigured package (```controllers``` by default) ie

```java
//requires default constructor
public class Application extends Controller {
  
  @Inject static Service s;

  public static Result index() {
    return ok(index.render(s.demonstrate()));
  }
  
}
```

* Dependency modules are configurable (by default it's ```module.Dependencies```)

* Allows direct access to the factory method ie 

```java
//in Global.java
play.Play.application().plugin(InjectPlugin.class).getInstance(MyServiceInterface.class)
```

# How to install

* add 

play 2.0.2:

```"com.typesafe" % "play-plugins-guice" % "2.0.3"``` to your dependencies

play 2.0.1:

```"com.typesafe" % "play-plugins-guice" % "2.0.2"``` to your dependencies


* create a file called ```play.plugins``` in your ```app/conf``` directory

* add ```1500:com.typesafe.plugin.inject.GuicePlugin```

* that's it

# Testing

* testing can be achieved two ways in case of using field injection:

  * making the injected dependencies anything but private

  * injected dependencies can be private in which case a new constructor (alongside with an empty default one) could be added to controllers which could be used to inject the mocked dependencies
  (I would recommend the former solution)

* testing is trivial in case of using constructor injection.
