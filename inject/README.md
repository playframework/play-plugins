# Manual Injection Plugin

This plugin provides support for manual dependency injection. Injection points are defined using ```@Provides``` (and ```@Singleton```) annotations in a class called ```module.Dependencies```. 
These would be injected into a preconfigured package (```controllers``` by default)

# Features

* Allows static field injection to a preconfigured package (```controllers``` by default) ie

(see ```sample``` for a full example)

```java
// define your dependencies in module/Dependencies.java
public class Dependencies {
  
  @Provides 
  @Singleton
  public Something makeSomething() { 
    return new SpecialSomething();
  }

  @Provides 
  @Singleton
  public MyService makeService(Something s) {
    return new SpecialService(s);
  }


}
```

```java
//any controller
public class Application extends Controller {
  
  @Inject static MyService s;

  public static Result index() {
    return ok(index.render(s.demonstrate()));
  }
  
}

```

* or you can use constructor injection with a delege
(see ```sample_without_static_field``` for a full example)

in app/controllers/Application.java:

```java
public class Application extends Controller {

  private MyService s;

  @Inject public Application( MyService s) {
    this.s=s;
  }

  public  Result index() {
    return ok(index.render(s.demonstrate()));
  }

}
```

in app/module/Dependencies.java:

```java
public class Dependencies {

  public static InjectPlugin inject() {
    return Play.application().plugin(InjectPlugin.class);
  }
  
  //this is needed for each controller
  public static controllers.Application application() {
    return inject().getInstance(controllers.Application.class);
  }

  @Provides
  @Singleton
  public Something makeSomething() {
    return new Something() {
      public String noWhat() {
        return "yay";
      }
    };
  }

  @Provides
  @Singleton
  public MyService makeService(Something s) {
    return new MyService(s) {
      public String demonstrate() { return s.noWhat();}
    };
  }

}
```


in ```conf/routes```:

```
GET     /                           module.Dependencies.application.index
```

* Dependency modules are configurable (by default it's ```module.Dependencies```)

* Allows direct access to the factory method ie 

```java 
//in Global.java
play.Play.application().plugin(InjectPlugin.class).getInstance(MyServiceInterface.class)
```

# How to install

* add 

play 2.0.2:

```"com.typesafe" % "play-plugins-inject" % "2.0.3"``` to your dependencies

play 2.0.1:

```"com.typesafe" % "play-plugins-inject" % "2.0.2"``` to your dependencies


* create a file called ```play.plugins``` in your ```app/conf``` directory

* add ```1500:com.typesafe.plugin.inject.ManualInjectionPlugin```

* that's it

# Testing

* testing can be achieved two ways while using the static field injection:

  * making the injected dependencies anything but private

  * injected dependencies can be private in which case a new constructor could be added to controllers which could be used to inject the mocked dependencies
  (I would recommend the former solution)
* if the static delegate approach was used, one can directly test the controller
